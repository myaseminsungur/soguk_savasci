# Soğuk Savaşçı

Soğuk Savaşçı is a project aimed at creating a dad joke generator using a fine-tuned language model (LLM). The inspiration for this project comes from the famous YouTube channel in Türkiye named Soğuk Savaş, known for its witty and humorous dad jokes.

## Project Aim

The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can generate high-quality dad jokes in Turkish. This involves creating a fine-tuning dataset, training the model, and iterating on the results to improve joke quality.

## What I Did

1. **Dataset Creation:**
   - Collected dad jokes from the Soğuk Savaş YouTube channel.
   - Compiled these jokes into a fine-tuning dataset.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tuned a GPT-4o-mini model using the OpenAI API with the initial dataset.
   - Evaluated the results, which were not initially satisfying.

3. **Improving the Dataset:**
   - Generated joke reasonings using the LLM to provide context and improve joke quality.
   - Added these reasonings to the fine-tuning dataset.

4. **Re-Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tuned the model again with the enhanced dataset.
   - Observed improved results, though still not fully satisfying.

## Current Status

This project is a work in progress. While the results have improved with the addition of joke reasonings, there is still room for enhancement. I will continue studying and refining the model to achieve better joke quality.

## Community Involvement

I am open to any suggestions from the community to help improve this project. If you have any ideas, feedback, or contributions, please feel free to share them.
